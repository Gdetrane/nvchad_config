# My custom configuration for Neovim Nvchad

[Nvchad](https://www.nvchad.com) has lots of great features ootb, such as a built-in theming engine with dozens of default themes, Mason, Lazy, etc. 

This is just my personal configuration, with all the LSPs I would use and extra plugins I deem essential. It's pretty much an ongoing
work in progress.
